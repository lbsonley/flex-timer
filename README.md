## on PostCSS and Tailwind

CSS Post Processing is handled entirely with PostCSS. There is no SASS which means no nesting CSS selectors. `@import` is available via [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import). For more detailed information see [postcss.config.js](./postcssconfig.js).

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) is the preferred way to style.
